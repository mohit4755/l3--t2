The Navbar component contains the main navigation links of the application:

Home: Redirects to the homepage.
Services: Links to the services section.
Internship: Redirects to the internship details page.

A button that allows the user to easily return to the homepage.

Appealing Visuals: A gradient background and carefully chosen fonts make this section stand out.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS 🎨
This project leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, which makes it easy to design responsive, clean, and reusable components. The following design principles were followed:

Utility-first: Tailwind's utility-first approach was used to quickly style elements with minimal custom CSS.
Responsive design: Tailwind's responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) were used to ensure the app works across all screen sizes.
Custom Tailwind configuration: We customized the Tailwind configuration to meet the specific needs of this project, including custom colors and spacing values.

## Future Enhancements 🔮
There are several improvements and features that could be added to the project in the future:

Backend Integration: Connect the frontend with a backend (using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB) to handle user authentication, dynamic content fetching, and more.
Authentication: Implement user login and registration, allowing users to access personalized content.
Dark Mode: Add a toggle for users to switch between dark and light modes.
Animations: Introduce more advanced animations using libraries like Framer Motion or React Spring.
Accessibility Improvements: Enhance the accessibility of the site for users with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
